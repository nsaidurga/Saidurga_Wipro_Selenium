2. Demonstrate the use of the super keyword
Use of Super Keyword:
	
(1)super() is used inside the child class constructor
   to call the constructor of the parent class.
	 
(2)It must be the first statement in the constructor.

(3)super.methodName() can call a method from the parent class

(4)If a variable name is the same in both classes, 
   super.variableName helps access the parent class variable.
	 
(5)super helps in code reuse by using methods and constructors
  from the base (super) class.
	 
(6)It allows passing values from child class to parent class 
   constructor.
	 
(7)Avoids redundancy by reusing existing functionality in the 
   superclass.
