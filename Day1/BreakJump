3. What is the difference between break and continue statements?

Both break and continue are jump statements used inside loops or switch statements to 
alter the normal flow of control, but they behave very differently.

Break statement:
break is used to exit the loop or switch block immediately.
Ex:
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break;
    }
    System.out.print(i);
}
output: 1 2 


Continue statement:
continue is used to skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.
Ex:
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.print(i);
}
output: 1 2 4 5
