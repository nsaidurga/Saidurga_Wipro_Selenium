2.Explain the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types in Java.

(a) Primitive Data Types:
	Definition: These are the basic, built-in data types provided by Java.
	
	Types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean.
	
	Size and Structure: Fixed size, memory-efficient, and store simple values.
	
	Operations: Perform operations directly using operators (+, -, etc.).
	
	Default Values: Have default values (e.g., 0 for int, false for boolean).
	
	Not Objects: They are not objects and donâ€™t have methods.
	
	Stored in: Stored in the stack memory.

(b) Non-Primitive Data Types:
	Definition: These are data types created using classes and interfaces.
	
	Examples: String, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces, Wrapper classes, etc.
	
	Size and Structure: Can be large, complex, and dynamic in size.
	
	Operations: Require methods to operate (.length(), .equals(), etc.).
	
	Default Values: Default value is null.
	
	Are Objects: They are objects and have methods and properties.
	
	Stored in: Stored in the heap memory (reference in stack).
