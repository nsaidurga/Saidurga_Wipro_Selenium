5. What is operator precedence? How does it affect the outcome of expressions?

Operator Precedence:
it determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.
Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before lower ones.

Operator Precedence Affects Expressions in Java:
Operator precedence affects how an expression is evaluated, especially 
when multiple operators are involved without parentheses.

int result = 10 + 5 * 2;  
System.out.println(result);
it prints 20 instead of 30 because * has high precedence than + .

Order of operator precedence:
() – Parentheses 
++, -- – Unary 
 *, /, %
+, -
