5. Explain the differences between while and do-while loops with examples.

Both while and do-while loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly,
but they differ in when the condition is checked.

While loop:
The condition is checked first, before executing the loop body.
Loop may not run even once if the condition is false.
Ex:

int i = 1;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.print(i);
    i++;
}

output: 1 2 3 4


Do while loop:
The loop body is executed first, then the condition is checked.
The loop executes at least once, even if the condition is false.
Ex:

int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.print(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);

output: 1 2 3 4 5
